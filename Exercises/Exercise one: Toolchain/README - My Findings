After running each of the make files, i have noticed that the output from the file is different each time.
The first make file output in the console what thread it launched 3x from and the output in different order each thread that was launched.
The second make file output almost in numerical order the first 4 were scrambled and coming towards the end of the file it output that it launched from main.
The third and final make file output in complete different order and repeat itself on the first output.
